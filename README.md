# jamf-post-to-webhook
Simple jamf script that posts computer info to a webhook. It utilizes Jamf variables to post computer data to a webhook. You could use a service like Zapier to catch the webhook and post that data to another place, like a Google Sheet.

**Please note:** I am new to this. Be gentle.
